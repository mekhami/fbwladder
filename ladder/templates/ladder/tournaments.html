    <h1>Foreign Brood War Ladder Season 1 Tournament</h1>

    <p>It is our pleasure to introduce the FBWL Season 1 Finale Tournament on July 29th, 2017. The ladder has been a tremendous success, with hundreds of games being played in the first month, and numerous new members of our community taking part. To cap off the first season, we are launching a four round, Top 16 tournament featuring the best players in the FBW Discord community. With casters from within our community and viewership hopefully across many communities, we think this tournament will be a fun, competitive event</p>

    <p>The prize pool is TBD (and we encourage any of you who would like to donate to the priz epool to do so) and <b>all</b> qualified players will receive some portion of the prizes.</p>

    <p>Currently, the great <b>Schamtoo</b> has agreed to cast the tournament, and we would be thrilled to take applicants from other members who want to throw their hat in the casting ring.</p>

    <p>To outline:</p>

    <h2>About 'Foreign' and 'Korean'</h2>
    <p>It's been a hot topic of discussion recently about what constitutes foreign and Korean, and how these tournaments should be segregated as to best grow the community, provide good viewing experiences, and be inclusive. It's not an easy question to answer. The following is the current stance of FBW Discord Ladder:</p>
    <p>As a foreign community-driven event, we will be barring entry of professional and semi-professional players (players who have previously or currently attended prestiguous tournaments in Korea such as but not limited to: OSL, MSL, ASL, and other Kespa/Afreeca sponsored events. We have taken this stance as our discord as well as the foreign community at large has an influx of new players, players transitioning from StarCraft 2, and players who are just coming back after a long hiatus. Our aim with this ladder, although competitive in nature, is also about welcoming and encouraging participation among said players in a friendly environment where they have the chance to play likeminded people.</p>

    <p><b>We look forward to seeing you there!</b></p>
